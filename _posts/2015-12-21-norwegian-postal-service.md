**Challenge**: 

Clean up, redesign and prototype a highly complex logistics product line for the Norwegian Postal Service (B2C/B2B). Envision how it can be presented online to the customer in the future, focusing on building a great user experience. Optimize prototype to ensure buy-in from leadership and board of directors. 

**Process**: 

As part of a two person team, I created a high fidelity protoype for the Norwegian Postal Service (Posten) and their B2B offerings (Bring), aimed at creating the online user experience of the future, for both desktop and mobile.
The client restructured their product offering (several hundred products) in an effort to make the jungle of products easier to navigate for the end user. We defined, refined and detailed the products for presentation online.
The prototype was brought to life with two developers, and proved decisive for the client in securing support from top management, the organisation as whole and finally, through user testing, the end user, for the new product structure.
